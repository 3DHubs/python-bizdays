# bizdays

In several countries and markets, the accountability of the price of a financial
instrument, mainly bonds and derivatives, involves the use of different
rules to compute the way the days go by.
In some countries, like in Brazil, several financial instrument only pay interest for business days along their life cycle.
Therefore, having a way to compute the number of business days between 2 dates is quite useful to price the financial instruments properly.
It is necessary the holidays which occur between the 2 dates, to compute the business days and they are intrinsically related to counties and local markets.
In Brazil, [ANBIMA](www.anbima.com.br) disposes a file with a list of holidays up to the year of 1978 which are largely used by market practioners for pricing financial instruments.
<!-- Usually you have a list with the holidays and all you want
is to find out the number of business days between two dates, nothing more. 
It is necessary for pricing properly the financial instrument. -->
Several financial libraries compute the holidays, giving no option to users set it by their own.
Furtherly, the financial calendar is usually a small feature of a huge library, as [quantlib](quantlib.org), for example, and some users, including myself, don't want to put a hand in such a huge library only to use the financial calendar.

**bizdays** is a pure Python relying on its simplicity and the
power of Python's batteries.
bizdays computes business days between two dates and
other collateral effects, like adjust a given date for the next or previous
business day, check whether a date is a business day, creates generators of
business days sequences, and so forth.
bizdays is a module without further dependencies, what makes it appropriated for small implementations.

## Install

**bizdays** is avalilable at PyPI, so it is pip and easy_install instalable.

	pip install bizdays

or

	easy_install bizdays

## Using

Business days calculations are done for a given calendar specification. The
calendar specification is a `.cal` file containing the weekdays to be
considered as non-business days and a iso-formated list of dates representing
holidays. Here follows an example:

	Saturday
	Sunday
	2012-12-25
	2013-01-01

Let's suppose that file is named `Test.cal`.
So, that file specifies the `Test` calendar.
To create that calendar you need to instanciate the class `Calendar` providing the calendar's name.

	cal = Calendar('Test')

Important: the dates inside file must be ISO-formated (`YYYY-mm-dd` or `%Y-%m-%d`).

To compute the business days between two dates you call `bizdays` passing a tuple with the dates defining the period you are interested in (*from* and *to* dates).

	days = cal.bizdays(('2012-12-31', '2013-01-03'))
	# 2

For simplicity, and convenience, it is provided the `currentdays` method, to keep similar functionalities in the same framework, although I suppose it is useless.

	days = cal.currentdays(('2012-12-31', '2013-01-03'))
	# 3

Here we have the output of `cal` for January of 2013 which allow us to check the results.

	      Janeiro       
	Do Se Te Qu Qu Se SÃ¡
	       1  2  3  4  5
	 6  7  8  9 10 11 12
	13 14 15 16 17 18 19
	20 21 22 23 24 25 26
	27 28 29 30 31      

Several contracts, by default, always expiry in the same day, for example, 1st Januray, which isn't a business day, so instead of carrying your code
with awful test you could call `adjust_next` which returns the given date
whether it is a business day or the next business day.

	cal.adjust_next('2013-01-01')
	# '2013-01-02'
	cal.adjust_next('2013-01-02')
	# '2013-01-02'

We also have `adjust_previous`, although I suppose it is unusual, too.

	cal.adjust_previous('2013-01-01')
	# '2012-12-31'

To execute calculations through sequential dates, sometimes you must consider only business days.
For example, you want to compute the price of a bond from its issue date up to its maturity.
You have to walk over business days in order to carry the contract up to maturity.
To accomplish that you use the `seq` method (stolen from R) which returns a sequence generator of business days.

	for dt in cal.seq(('2012-12-31', '2013-01-03')):
	    print dt
			
	# 2012-12-31
	# 2013-01-02
	# 2013-01-03
